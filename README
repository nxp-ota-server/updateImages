Following files must be included:
.
|-- update.json
|-- 0.0.0
|-- 0.1.0
|-- 0.2.0
\-- 0.3.0
   |-- ls1021aiot
   |  |-- u-boot.bin
   |  |-- uImage
   |  |-- rootfs.ext4
   |  \-- firmware_sdcard.bin
   |  
   |-- ls1012ardb-64b
   |-- ls1012ardb-32b
   |-- ls1043ardb-64b
   |-- ls1043ardb-32b
   |-- ls1046ardb-64b

update.json is a json file that can send information to device boards. The file is written like this:
	{
		 /* set yes or no to tell devices is it need to update. */
		"updateStatus":"yes",

		/* which part to update, you can write "all", "u-boot", 
		   "filesystem"	*/
		"updatePart":"filesystem",

		/* version of update firmware */
		"updateVersion":"0.3.0",
	}

Images for OTA were stored in path: <updateVersion>/<boardname>/
	u-boot.bin  /* this is u-boot image for update. In ls1012ardb folder,this image include RCW and u-boot */
	uImage		/* this is kernel image for update */
	rootfs.ext4 /* this is filesystem image for update */
	firmware_sdcard.bin /* this is a full firmware of SD card image */
	kernel-ls1043a-rdb.itb /* this is an itb file and only ls1043ardb and ls1046ardb will use it. */
